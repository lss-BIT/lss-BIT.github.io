# About Me

<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic">

I am currently a second-year Master student at Beijing Institute of Technology, under the mentorship of [Prof. Guoyuan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=xSf5O4IAAAAJ). My academic journey has been a progressive pursuit of excellence across top-tier institutions. I completed my bachelor’s degree at Southwest University, guided by [Prof. Libo Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8I-krtYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), who first ignited my passion for academic inquiry. 

My research lies at the dynamic intersection of cognitive neuroscience, large language models, and complex networks. 

I am enthusiastic about forging collaborative partnerships across disciplines and welcome opportunities to work with researchers who share similar interests or complementary expertise. Feel free to reach out to me directly via email at — **lv_shuo@foxmail.com**.
